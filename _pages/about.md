<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Zhenrong Wang, and I am a third-year undergraduate student at Shenzhen University, majoring in Electronic Information Engineering. I am expected to graduate in June 2026. My research is supervised by Professor [Wenming Cao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uPxjSDIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Assistant Professor [Qi Zheng](https://hoi-tg.github.io/).

## Research Interests

- Human Action Recognition  
- Human and Object Interaction  
- Humanoid Skill Learning

Currently, I am conducting research on humanoid interaction. I am looking for a PhD position starting in Fall 2026.
